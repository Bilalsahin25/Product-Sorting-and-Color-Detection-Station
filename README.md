Product Sorting and Color Detection Station
This project is an automation system developed using Factory I/O, Siemens S7-1200 PLC, TIA Portal, and SCADA. The goal is to detect products of different colors on a conveyor belt and transfer them to separate conveyors based on their color group.

Technologies Used
Factory I/O: For virtual system design and simulation.
Siemens S7-1200 PLC: For automation control programming.
TIA Portal: For PLC programming and HMI (SCADA) screen design.
SCADA: For operator interface design and process monitoring.
Analog Sensors: For detecting product colors.
Pneumatic Actuators: To transfer products between conveyors.
Conveyor Systems: For product movement and transportation.
How the System Works
Product Detection: Analog sensors detect the colors of products on the conveyor belt.
Color Sorting: The PLC processes the detected color data and generates the appropriate output signal.
Transfer Mechanism: Pneumatic actuators transfer products to the corresponding conveyor based on their color.
SCADA Monitoring: A SCADA interface visualizes the entire process and provides system status information to the user.
